# DaXBench-DMP
We employ DaXBench as a cloth simulator to analyze Deformable Object Manipulation (DOM), and the Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) method is applied to generate a series of parameterized trajectories by imitation learning.  The trajectories then are used in DaXBench cloth simulation environment to do folding manipulation.
